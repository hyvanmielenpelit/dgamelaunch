# This is an example gnollhackrc file. You should edit this to suit the needs
# of your personal GnollHack build and add some reasonable default options
# for your users.

# If you compiled dgamelaunch with the `vi' editor enabled instead of ee,
# perhaps a helpful blurb such as this might help:

# This editor is vi-like. Type ESC a couple times, then ':q!' (without quotes)
# to exit if you get stuck. To save, hit ESC and then ZZ or type ':wq'
# (without quotes.) To insert text, hit 'i' to enter insert mode.

# Here are some examples of reasonable defaults:

OPTIONS=showexp,showscore,time,color,!autopickup
OPTIONS=autodig,fruit:slime mold,boulder:0
OPTIONS=number_pad:2,altmeta,force_invmenu,hilite_pet

# Highlight menu lines with different colors. You need to define the colors
# with MENUCOLOR lines.
#  Toggle menucolor use on or off
OPTIONS=menucolors
# Define color used for a certain menu line. Format is
#    MENUCOLOR="regular expression"=color
# or
#    MENUCOLOR="regular expression"=color&attribute
#  Show all blessed items in green
MENUCOLOR=" blessed " = green
#  Show all holy water in green
MENUCOLOR=" holy water" = green
#  Show all cursed items in red
MENUCOLOR=" cursed " = red
#  Show all unholy water in red
MENUCOLOR=" unholy water" = red
#  Show all cursed worn items in orange and underlined
MENUCOLOR=" cursed .* (being worn)" = orange&underline
#  Show all cooling down items in black
MENUCOLOR="(cooling down)" = black
#  Show all forgotten spells in black
MENUCOLOR="(You cannot recall this spell)" = black
#  Show all spells that do not have any components in black
MENUCOLOR="(Not required)" = black
